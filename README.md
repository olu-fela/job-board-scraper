# Job Board Scraper

## Version 1
This is a Python script that:
- Scrapes multiple job boards (Indeed, LinkedIn, Glassdoor, RemoteRocketShip)
- Filters for remote Data Science, Data Engineering, and Data Analysis jobs
- Sends an email alert with new job postings
- Runs automatically every 24 hours

**Next Steps**
- Set up your email credentials (replace "your_email@gmail.com" and "your_email_password" in the script).
- Run the script on a server or local machine (use cron jobs or Windows Task Scheduler for automation).
- Modify job search filters if needed (add/remove job boards or keywords).
